# Tibia IP-Changer
This is a simple command line IP-Changer for old Tibia clients. Its main feature is having multiple server configurations stored in a configuration file (see `ipchanger.exe -help`). Only a few client versions are currently supported (7.7, 8.1, 8.6) but it should be straighforward to expand to others. There is also a memory scan tool that can be used to help with scanning memory addresses for yet unsupported clients.

Both are Windows specific and can be compiled by running `build.bat` from the visual studio shell. They're very simple so I wont bother explaining them further. For more details, the source code should be very readable.
